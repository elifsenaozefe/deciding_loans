Conclusion
--
After running Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and SVM models (some with parameter searching conditions), SVC with parameters C = 10 & degree = 1 & gamma = scale gives best results with F1-score = 0.83 & accuracy score = 0.89.

<b> Beside this result, it is clear that SVM takes longer time than the others but for this data, it doesn't create a huge difference in evaluation metrics. </b>
